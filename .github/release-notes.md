The hub as a program for Windows, with the interface inside it.

## Install

Without administrator rights, for one user. The `install.ps1` of this release installs exactly this release: it
downloads the archive, checks it against `SHA256SUMS` and hands over to `tasks-hub install`. No GitHub login is
needed: run it in your own terminal (PowerShell not elevated):

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/WKDSteve/tasks-desktop/releases/download/{tag}/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Or save `install.ps1` from this page and run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1` (a plain
`.\install.ps1` is blocked: by the execution policy, or by the mark a browser puts on a downloaded file).

To add a link, pass the argument (the Options menu of the page registers the hub with your login, if you want that); a pipe into `iex` takes none, so run the
script as a script block in a PowerShell session:

```
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://github.com/WKDSteve/tasks-desktop/releases/download/{tag}/install.ps1))) -InstallArgs '--shortcut'
```

The program downloaded by the script is not stopped by SmartScreen; what is checked instead is that it is the file
`SHA256SUMS` of this release lists.

Run the same script again to repair this release (to update, take the script of a newer release); remove the program
with `uninstall.ps1` (your settings stay unless you add `-PurgeSettings`; your vault is never touched). The install
script comes from the release-kit of appkit, the uninstall script from `scripts/` at this tag; both are listed in
`SHA256SUMS`.

## Files

| System | Archive |
| ------ | ------- |
| Windows (x86-64) | `tasks-hub-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` |

There is no Linux or macOS build any more: the release is made on the author's Windows machine.

`SHA256SUMS` lists the checksum of every file (archive and scripts):

```
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

The program is not signed yet: Windows may show SmartScreen. The script does not need that.

The tasks engine (`tasks.nvim`, Neovim 0.12 or newer) is not part of the archive.
