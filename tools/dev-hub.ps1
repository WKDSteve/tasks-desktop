<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Build this checkout and run the hub from target/, to look at the interface.

.DESCRIPTION
  Builds the UI, makes cargo embed it, builds the hub, points it at the local engine checkouts and
  runs it. Nothing is installed: no `install`, no `autostart`, no registry or AppData entry.

  Run it in a normal terminal. A Claude session (the Claude app redirects AppData and HKCU) is
  refused on purpose, except with -Measure, which touches neither.

.PARAMETER Release
  Build and run the release profile instead of debug.

.PARAMETER NoBuild
  Skip the UI and cargo builds and run what is in target/.

.PARAMETER Background
  `start --open` (hub in the background, browser opened) instead of `serve` (until Ctrl-C). Stop it
  with `tasks-hub stop`.

.PARAMETER Measure
  Measure instead of showing: build as asked, then run tools/measure-hub.py against the vault. It
  starts the hub on a free port with a config folder of its own in the temp folder (the installed
  hub, its settings and port 17615 are left alone), times the start, the snapshot, the search and
  the task detail, prints a Markdown report and ends that hub again. Use it with -Release: the
  numbers of docs/PERFORMANCE.md are from a release build.

.PARAMETER Runs
  With -Measure: requests per series (default 20).

.PARAMETER Out
  With -Measure: also write the report to this file.

.PARAMETER Vault
  The vault the engine reads ($TASKS_VAULT). Default: the vault already set, else $REPOS_DIR/tasks-vault.

.EXAMPLE
  .\tools\dev-hub.ps1
  .\tools\dev-hub.ps1 -Background
  .\tools\dev-hub.ps1 -NoBuild -Release
  .\tools\dev-hub.ps1 -Release -Measure
