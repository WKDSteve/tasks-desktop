//! The hub: talks to the tasks.nvim engine and serves its documents.
//!
//! The engine is the only thing that reads or writes task files; nothing in
//! this crate parses frontmatter (concept 3.2). The engine is reached
//! through a trait so the one-process-per-call `CliEngine` of P2 can later
//! give way to a persistent host without touching the routes.
