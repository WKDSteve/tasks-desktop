// (their handles in IndexedDB), and the permission to read them, which the browser asks again after a restart.

// The code is the kit's (appkit-web/folder); this names what is the tasks page's own: the mode it asks for, the id the
// picker remembers its start folder under, and the database its handles are kept in. Every local file shares the origin
// file://, so another app's page (testing-web) keeps its handles in a database of its own name, never in this one.
